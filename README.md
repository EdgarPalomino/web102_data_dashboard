## Notes

It was a bit difficult for me to figure out when specifically to make the calls to the Open Opus API and also the ways in which I should handle the state renderings with the addition of asynchronous JavaScript. However, in the end I was able to understand how approach these challenges after studying how the JavaScript Fetch API and the React useEffect hook work!
